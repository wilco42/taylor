A div with an id of 'slideshow' contains five images, the first of which is shown and the 
others are hidden using a display style of none. Using Javascript, create a simple slideshow 
that cycles through the images, displaying each image for three seconds at a time, looping 
back to the first image when the end is reached. You cannot use jQuery or any other library.
